Technologies Used

Python – Core programming language

Tkinter – For creating the graphical user interface (GUI)

tkinter.messagebox – To display winner pop-up messages

1) Key Features

3×3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid created using Tkinter buttons

Two-player gameplay (Player X and Player O)

Automatic turn switching between players

Winning condition detection using predefined combinations

Winning row highlighted in green

Pop-up message displays the winner

Prevents further moves after a player wins

2) How It Works

Each cell is a button stored in a list

Button clicks update the grid with the current player’s symbol

The game checks all possible winning combinations after each move

If a winner is found, the game stops and displays the result

3) Purpose of the Project

This project demonstrates:

Basic GUI development in Python

Event handling using button clicks

Game logic implementation

Use of functions, global variables, and condition checking
